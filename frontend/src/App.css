/*
 * App.css - Component-specific styles for App component
 *
 * Currently empty because we're using Tailwind CSS utility classes.
 * Add custom CSS here only if you need styles that can't be achieved with Tailwind.
 *
 * Example use cases:
 * - Complex animations
 * - Very specific custom styles
 * - Override third-party library styles
